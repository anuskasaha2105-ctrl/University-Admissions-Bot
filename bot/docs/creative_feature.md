#🌟 Creative Feature:  Personalized Admission Recommendation

## Feature Overview
The Personalized Admission Recommendation feature enhances the University Admission Bot by providing tailored guidance to students based on their academic background and preferences. Instead of generic responses, the bot offers customized program and university suggestions.

## How It Works
1. The bot asks the student for basic information such as:
   - Academic stream
   - Previous qualifications
   - Marks or grades
   - Preferred field of study
2. The input data is analyzed against stored eligibility rules.
3. Matching programs and universities are identified.
4. Personalized recommendations are generated and presented to the student.

## Example Interaction
**Student:** I want to study engineering  
**Bot:** Please provide your 12th-grade stream and marks  
**Student:** Science with 85%  
**Bot:** Based on your profile, you are eligible for B.Tech programs at XYZ University and ABC Institute.
